# about sudoku_solver
A simple sudoku solver library plus testing code. 
This repository is the result of me attempting (successfully) to use the backtracking algorithm to solve a square Sudoku puzzle of unknown size. 
I tested it successfully against a few examples from Kaggle and its surprisingly fast altough its not really optimized for anything. 

I chose to use Javascript thinking that it will be easy to take this code and embed it in a web site as it has no dependencies

It you are looking for an explanation how to solve sudoku using backtracking or about backtracking algorithms in general you may want to visit the blog post I wrote to explain it:
