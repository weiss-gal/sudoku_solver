# about sudoku_solver
A simple sodoku solver library plus testing code. 
This repository is the result of me attempting (successfully) to use the backtracking algorithm to solve a square Sudoku puzzle of unknown size. 
I tested it successfully against a few examples from Kaggle and its surprisingly fast altough its not really optimized for anything. 

I chose to use Javascript thinking that it will be easy to take this code and embed it in a web site as it has no dependencies

Feel free to use it for any purpose, but remember to respect the license conditions.
